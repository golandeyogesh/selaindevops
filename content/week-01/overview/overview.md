Welcome to the first week of the RhinOps Bootcamp!

During the Bootcamp you will learn about what is Devops and what are the tools and methodologies to implement it by learning from our extensive resources library and getting your hands dirty by completing the project for each week. This first week is all about giving you a high level understanding of what is DevOps and why do we need it. Each of the following weeks we are going to deep dive into each one of the methodologies so it is very important that you understand their purpose by the end of this week.

Let's start by defining what is DevOps:

  - "*DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.*"

And what are the main DevOps practices:

  - **Source Code Management:** Source Code Management (SCM) systems helps to maintain the code base. It allows multiple developers to work on the code concurrently. It prevents them from overwriting the code and helps them to work in parallel from different locations.

  - **Continuous Testing:** This practice incorporates automated, prescheduled, continued code tests as application code is being written or updated. Such tests can speed the delivery of code to production.

  - **Continuous Integration (CI):** This practice brings configuration management (CM) tools together with other test and development tools to track how much of the code being developed is ready for production. It involves rapid feedback between testing and development to quickly identify and resolve code issues.

  - **Continuous Delivery (CD):** This practice automates the delivery of code changes, after testing, to a preproduction or staging environment. An staff member might then decide to promote such code changes into production.

  - **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Similar to continuous delivery, this practice automates the release of new or changed code into production. A company doing continuous deployment might release code or feature changes several times per day. The use of container technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, can enable continuous deployment by helping to maintain consistency of the code across different deployment platforms and environments.

  - **Artifact Repository Management:** system used to manage the builds artifacts. It is dedicated server which is used to store all the binaries which were outputs of the successful builds.

  - **Continuous Monitoring:** This practice involves ongoing monitoring of both the code in operation and the underlying infrastructure that supports it. A feedback loop that reports on bugs or issues then makes its way back to development.

  - **Infrastructure as Code:** This practice can be used during various DevOps phases to automate the provisioning of infrastructure required for a software release. Developers add infrastructure “code” from within their existing development tools. For example, developers might create a storage volume on demand from Docker, Kubernetes, or OpenShift. This practice also allows operations teams to monitor environment configurations, track changes, and simplify the rollback of configurations.

  - **Configuration Management:** is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state. It’s a way to make sure that a system performs as it’s expected to as changes are made over time.

  - **Microservices:**: an architectural approach in software development. They structure complex applications as a collection of small, loosely coupled services. 

  - **Container:** is a software package that bundles the application source code and all required software dependencies into one unit, ready to be immediately deployed in any environment.
