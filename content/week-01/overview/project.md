## Note

Because this week is the first of the bootcamp there is no project. However, it's highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the bootcamp application to be prepared for the following weeks. This includes building and deploying the application locally (the application can run on both windows and linux).

The application is available here: https://github.com/sela-rhinops/bootcamp-app
