In the first week of the bootcamp we focused on understanding the bootcamp ecosystem:

- ***Discord:*** Platform for communication
- ***Zoom:*** Used to host the meetings
- ***Quizzes:*** Platform for the quizes
- ***Bootcamp Portal:*** Contain all the instructions and resources 

In addition, so far we learned what devops is, what it's used for and why is it so important today. However, this week we are going to begin to delve into technical topics and start to build the knowledge that will allow us to work as DevOps engineers at the end of the Bootcamp. This week we will learn the following:

- ***Version Control:*** Also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. This week you will learn what is a VCS (Version Control System) and learn one of the most used tools in the market, Git. 

- ***Scripting Basics:*** In this week's project you will be asked to create a basic script using Bash and store it on your own Git Repository (also there will be a bonus with Powershell). Knowing the basics of scripting is a prerequisite of the Bootcamp, however if it's not something that you know, don't worry, this week includes resources that will help you learn it (but remember, you should focus on git, scripting is something that you can keep learning week by week)
