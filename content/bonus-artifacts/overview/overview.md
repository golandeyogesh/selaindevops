Package managers are essential tools for any modern development platform, it is a mechanism where developers can create, share, and consume useful code. Often such code is bundled into "packages" that contain compiled code along with other content needed in the projects that consume these packages. The most common package managers are:

- npm --> Javascript
- nuget --> C#
- maven --> Java
- pip --> Python
- gems --> Ruby
- Conan --> C++
- apt --> debian/ubuntu
- yum --> centos
