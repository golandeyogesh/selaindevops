During this week we will have the opportunity to forge the foundations that we will need during the next weeks of the Bootcamp.

On the one hand, we will study the concepts associated with the development and operations teams and, on the other, we will learn through hands-on the application that will accompany us throughout the bootcamp: the Weight Tracker App.

The Weight Tracker App is an application developed by Okta which we forked to use as our Bootcamp application. The interesting thing about this application is that its development is very simple but it includes elements such as databases and integration with Okta.

Make sure you know the application in detail, we will continue working with it until the end of the Bootcmap!
