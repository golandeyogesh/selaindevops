- The Bootcamp is a very intense program that requires significant effort from the students' side (especially if you are currently working).

- It’s important to understand that the bootcamp is not a regular course (although it contains several technical sessions and workshops). Instead, it’s a program developed to help the students learn for themselves while solving the challenges that will prepare them for the job as a devops engineer.

- It’s also a selection process where we seek to find new talents with the DNA we are looking for to join our team.
