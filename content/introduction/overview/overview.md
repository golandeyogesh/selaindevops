The DevOps Bootcamp is a 10-week program designed to allow students as well as for already experienced developers and IT/Sysadmin to start their career as a DevOps engineer.

 During the Bootcamp, attendees will learn DevOps concepts and tools through hands-on projects based on real-life scenarios.

We believe that a good DevOps engineer should be able to learn and solve problems on their own so we are based on a model where we help and encourage the student to learn by himself.
