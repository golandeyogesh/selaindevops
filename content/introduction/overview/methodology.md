- Our learning methodology is based on the PBL (Project-Based Learning) pedagogy in which the students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems.

- During the process, we promote self-learning which is an essential tool that the student will acquire during the Bootcamp and will help him throughout his career. Likewise, the reviews of each project are used to prepare the student to be confident during job interviews.

- To achieve this, the Bootcamp divides the content into weeks and provides the student with an ecosystem that has the guidance and resources necessary to help the students meet the weekly objectives.
