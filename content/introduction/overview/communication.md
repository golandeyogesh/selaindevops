We encourage the use of discord for everything related to the bootcamp (questions, shared resources, etc) as it may be useful for everyone.

Discord is a VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform designed for creating communities. Users communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called “servers”.

During the Bootcamp we will use Discord as a centralized place for communications. In the following pages you will find more info on each channel and their usage.

In the Bootcamp Discord server you will find the following channels:
 
- **#announcements:** channel used for important announcements regarding the bootcamp.
- **#general:** open chat for students and mentors to talk
- **#suggestions:** channel used to recommend learning resources or sending suggestions to improve the bootcamp.
- **#week-n:** Every week a new “week-n” channel will be opened. This channel is for students and mentors to talk to ask questions specifically for the topic that will be covered each week
- **#student-name:** In the “STUDENT ONE ON ONE” category there will be a channel for every participant. This is a private channel between the participant and the mentors and it is used to send the deliveries of every week’s project or to discuss any private matter.
- **#room-n:** The rooms channels are video channels that can be used for students and mentors to talk.
