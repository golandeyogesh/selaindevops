This week we will get started with cloud computing. For this, we will study the Microsoft cloud solution: Azure.

This week lectures we will provide a foundational level knowledge on Azure concepts; core Azure services; core solutions and management tools; general security and network security; governance, privacy, and compliance features; Azure cost management and service level agreements.

In addition, during the week project we will put together everything we learned so far by deploying the WeightTracker application in Microsoft Azure in a virtual machine based environment.
