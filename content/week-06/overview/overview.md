This week we are going to see how configuration management can help us configure our servers and install our applications into it in an easy, repeatable and automated way. The tool that we are going to use is Ansible, which is one of the most widely used configuration management tools. During this week we will create an Ansible playbook that will automate the process of configuring and deploying our Weight Tracker application.
