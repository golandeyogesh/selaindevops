As you saw last week using resources in the cloud costs money. This week we will rebuild everything we did until now but using infrastructure as code to be able to automate the process of deploying infrastructure and have the ability to easily delete all resources when not in use.

In addition, in real life multiple environments are used for our applications. Generally at a least: Development, Staging and Production. Using Infrastructure as Code will help us in the future to create additional environments for our Weight Tracker Application easily.
