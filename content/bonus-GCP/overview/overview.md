First of all congratulations for getting here! It has not been easy but we have learned a lot during the process. After weeks of hard work this week we will take a "break" to fix the knowledge learned so far as we see how cloud services (on GCP) allow us to create great things with very little effort.


This week aims at three things:

1. **Prepare Portfolio**: You will have time to create a repository that summarizes all the work done so far including corrections received during projects feedbacks (very useful for job interviews that will begin soon)

2. **Workshop:** During this week's session we will build a serverless application that includes facial recognition and image analysis to extract and translate the text contained in them.

3. **Project:** In this week's project you will have to create cloud functions to have your first contact with Google Cloud (for this project we provide a detailed guide since the main objective of this week is to take the time to fix the knowledge learned so far).


The services we will learn this week are:

- **App Engine:** is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale.
- **Cloud Storage:** Object storage for companies of all sizes. Store any amount of data. Retrieve it as often as youâ€™d like.
- **Datastore:** is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development
- **Cloud Functions:** Scalable pay-as-you-go functions as a service (FaaS) to run your code with zero server management
- **Pub/Sub:** Allows services to communicate asynchronously, with latencies on the order of 100 milliseconds.
- **Cloud Vision API:** Allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content.
- **Cloud Translation API:** Uses Google's neural machine translation technology to instantly translate texts into more than one hundred languages.
