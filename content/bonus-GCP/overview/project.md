## Introduction

During the lecture we will deploy together a serverless application that allows a user to upload a photo of a person's face and learn how likely it is that the person is happy. Then we will take a photo that has been uploaded, examine it for text, extract any text that is found, translate that text into various languages, and then store those translations for easy retrieval.

## Project Overview

In order not to leave empty-handed, this week also includes a small project. However, for this project you will get a detailed guide explaining its implementation. In this project, you will create two Cloud Functions that when invoked via HTTP will display an “Hello World” message and an image of the Go gopher.

## Goals

- Create a Cloud Function that print a “Hello World” message
- Create a Cloud Function that print the “Gopher” mascot

## Considerations

- The code of the functions was previously created, you can find it in the directory "projects" in the following repository: https://github.com/sela-rhinops/bootcamp-gcp-workshop
- You can find a detailed guide describing the implementation in the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OXcTWQCPwNbsupA1GWTjG1CGO5ejIdY2Yrw8bJ-KeqQ/edit?usp=sharing

## Portfolio

In addition to the project, this week contains another delivery that is even more important, your portfolio. The idea is that you create a repository that summarizes all your work done so far (including the code and documentation) so that you can use it during job interviews.

## Delivery

- Send a link to the repo(s) containing your portfolio
- Send a link to your "HelloWorld" function
- Send a screenshot showing your "HelloWorld" function
- Send a link to your "Gopher" function
- Send a screenshot showing your "Gopher" function
